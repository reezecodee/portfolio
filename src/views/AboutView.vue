            Hello, I am Reeze...</h1>
        <p class="mb-7 text-start">Hi there! My name is <b>Atyla Azfa Al Harits</b>, but people usually call me <b>Harits</b> or <b>Al</b>.
            So, who is <b>Reeze</b>? Well, <b>Reeze</b> is the name I use on social media. Sometimes I feel a bit awkward using my real name because people often assume I'm a girlâ€”when actually, I'm a guy. I'm often active on Facebook and LinkedIn to share programming experiences.</p>
        <p class="mb-7 text-start">I'm someone who aspires to become a <b>Backend Developer</b> with the goal of becoming a
            skilled developer. Usually, I build web applications using technologies like Laravel, Livewire, VueJS, or
            AdonisJS. However, in the past few months, I have been trying to learn mobile applications with Dart
            Flutter.</p>
        <p class="mb-7 text-start">Besides programming, I'm an undergraduate student in Information Systems currently
            studying at a university in the city of Tasikmalaya. Outside of class time, I make time to watch Anime or
            learn languages like English and Japanese. Currently, I live in the city of Tasikmalaya, West Java to pursue
            my studies. <b>Don't hesitate to collaborate with me!</b>.
